        <h2 class="page-header">Team Based Science</h2>
        <p>The past several decades have witnessed a dramatic increase in the scale and complexity of scientific and translational research. As the complexity of today’s most pressing health issues and diseases is revealed, collaborations among scientists trained in different fields, from bioinformatics to molecular genetics to biomedical policy, have become essential for exploring and advancing biomedical research discoveries. Given their dual training in medicine and scientific research, physician scientists are poised to lead team science and the multidisciplinary research initiatives. Our session aims to answer: What constitutes successful team science? What are examples physician scientists have used in their research endeavors to promote team science productivity? Why do some research teams succeed while others do not? What factors maximize a research team’s productivity or effectiveness? What detracts from team science success?</p>

            <h4>David Ostrow, MD, PhD, DavidOstrowConsulting, David Ostrow &amp; Associates, LLC</h4>
            <p>During his training in the MD/PhD Program at the University of Chicago, Dr. David Ostrow co-founded the first gay community health center, now the Howard Brown Health Center of Chicago. There he identified Hepatitis B as a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) among gay men, which led to his Chicago PI role in the CDC-funded Hep B Epidemiology and Vaccine Efficacy Studies (1976-81). As the founding PI of the subsequent Chicago MACS (1983-1985), then co-PI of the Coping &amp; Change Study of Men in the Chicago MACS (1985-1999), and later founder of the Behavioral Working Group (BWG) of the MACS (1991-2011), he focussed on the relationship between sexual behavior, drug use and the evolution of HIV transmission and prevention among drug using MSM. He has published 175 peer-reviewed papers, 50+ book chapters and presented 60+ times at International AIDS Conferences. He is an Investigator or consultant on most of the NIDA funded studies of drugs, alcohol and HIV in the MACS, including his own study of the Social and Risk Networks Assessment of younger Black MSM (2009-2011). This study led to a recently funded study of the dynamic roles of social and risk networks as drivers of the increasing epidemic of new HIV infections among younger Black MSM in Chicago. As the senior behavioral investigator in the MACS, he plans to use the upcoming open recruitment of men at highest risk of or recently infected with HIV to extend these studies to the geographically and racially diverse cohort of HIV+ and HIV- men.</p>
            <p>Since the late ‘90s, Dr. Ostrow has been active in the movement to change failed national drug policies, such as cannabis prohibition, with more effective and compassionate policies, including regulation and legalization of cannabis use, integration of Cannabinoid Medicine training into the Medical Student curriculum, and the formation of a Community-Based Clinical Cannabis Research Network that can inform scientifically based MC treatment guidelines.</p>

        <h2 class="page-header">Transitioning</h2>
        <p>Mirroring the shift from medical to graduate school, the return to- and finishing of- medical school prompts medical scientist trainees to address one glaring challenge: starting the next chapter of our professional lives. The purpose of this panel is to enlighten audience members on how to smoothly navigate the often-stressful and seemingly complicated process of transitioning from the later phase of the MD/PhD curriculum towards your own, personal career trajectory. Consisting of a 4th year medical student, PSTP residency director, and resident/fellow on the panel, the intention is to open the entire room up for discussion. Though the focus is on transitions, all topics are highly encouraged for debate, ranging from questions about the traditional academic sequence (e.g., residency, interviewing, match, fellowship, etc.) to the more provocative consideration of non-academic career paths.</p>

            <p>Neelroop (Neel) Parikshak was born in Ahmedabad, India. While he was in elementary school, his family moved throughout the midwest and ultimately settled in West Virginia. Through grade school, Neel developed a love for math and science and first became interested in the neurosciences around the end of high school, when he experienced a few months of facial paralysis from Bells Palsy. He next attended college at Rice University, where he majored in Mathematics and Biochemistry and found that he enjoyed both neuroscience and medicine. Unable to decide between the two career routes, he joined the MD/PhD program at UCLA and completed his thesis work in the laboratory of Daniel H. Geschwind. His work focused on the genomics of neuropsychiatric disorders, with a particular emphasis on genes and pathways affected in autism spectrum disorder. He is generally interested in applying genomics, bioinformatics, and molecular biology approaches to dissect the etiology of complex diseases and identify data-driven therapeutic targets. He will be starting a Neurology residency program this summer and plans to continue pursuing his research interests. If all goes as planned, he hopes to be juggling clinical work, running a lab, and having a happy family life at home before he gets too many more grey hairs.</p>
