            <p>Michael S. Brown received an M.D. degree in 1966 from the University of Pennsylvania.  He was an intern and resident at the Massachusetts General Hospital, and a post doctoral fellow with Earl Stadtman at the National Institutes of Health.  He is currently Paul J. Thomas Professor of Molecular Genetics and Director of the Jonsson Center for Molecular Genetics at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas.  Dr. Brown and his colleague, Dr. Joseph L. Goldstein, discovered the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, which controls cholesterol in blood and in cells.  They showed that mutations in this receptor cause Familial Hypercholesterolemia, a disorder that leads to premature heart attacks.  Their work laid the groundwork for drugs called statins that block cholesterol synthesis, increase LDL receptors, lower blood cholesterol and prevent heart attacks.  Statins are taken daily by more than 20 million people worldwide.  Brown and Goldstein shared many awards for this work, including the U.S. National Medal of Science and the Nobel Prize for Medicine or Physiology.  Dr. Brown served for 16 years on the Board of Directors of Pfizer, and he is currently a Director of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.</p>

            <p>Huda Zoghbi is Professor of Pediatrics, Neurology, Neuroscience, and Molecular and Human Genetics at Baylor College of Medicine and serves as an Investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. She is also the Director of the Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute at Texas Children’s Hospital.</p>

            <p>Dr. Zoghbi Zoghbi’s interests range from neurodevelopment to neurodegeneration.  Her discovery that Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 1 is caused by expansion of a polyglutamine tract and that such expansion leads to accumulation of the mutant protein in neurons has had profound ramifications since many late-onset neurological disorders involve similar accumulations of disease-driving proteins.  Zoghbi’s work in neurodevelopment led to the discovery of the gene Math1/Atoh1 and to showing that it governs the development of several components of the proprioceptive, balance, hearing, vestibular, and breathing pathways.  Zoghbi’s group also discovered that mutations in MECP2 cause the neurological disorder Rett syndrome. We now know that mutations in this gene are responsible for a broad spectrum of disorders ranging from mild cognitive disabilities to autism. Her lab is focused on understanding how loss of MeCP2 alters neuronal function to cause behavioral abnormalities. Zoghbi trained many scientists and physician-scientists and is a member of several professional organizations and boards. Among Dr. Zoghbi’s honors are Gruber Prize in Neuroscience, the Pearl Meister Greengard Prize from Rockefeller University, the Scolnick Prize from MIT, and the March of Dimes Prize in Developmental Biology. In 2000 she was elected to the Institute of Medicine, and in 2004 she was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.</p>

            <p>Helen Mayberg, M.D. is Professor of Psychiatry, Neurology and Radiology and the Dorothy Fuqua Chair in Psychiatric Neuroimaging and Therapeutics at Emory University.  Over the last 25 years, her multi-disciplinary depression research team has worked to integrate cutting-edge imaging strategies, quantitative behavioral and psychophysiological metrics, and experimental treatment trials to define brain-based biomarkers that can optimize treatment selection for individual patients.  This work was foundational for the first studies of subcallosal cingulate deep brain stimulation for treatment resistant depression and remains the cornerstone of current studies to both refine and optimize DBS implementation and characterize network mechanisms mediating its antidepressant effects. Dr. Mayberg is a neurologist, trained at Columbia's Neurological Institute in New York, with fellowship training in nuclear medicine at Johns Hopkins. She is a member of the National Academy of Medicine, among other honors, and participates in a wide variety of editorial, advisory and scientific activities across multiple fields in neuroscience.</p>
